# fastCatan — High-Throughput Catan Simulator

## Context

Author is writing on RL for 4-player Settlers of Catan. Thesis goal: an RL agent that beats Alpha-Beta with statistical significance (>25% win rate over ≥1000 four-player games). The bottleneck the thesis explicitly calls out is simulator throughput — existing Python sim (Catanatron) can't generate self-play at the volume modern RL needs.

This plan designs `fastCatan`: a greenfield C++23 simulator with nanobind Python bindings, Gymnasium interface, targeting **5×10⁷ steps/sec/node** to make M3 self-play feasible, with full 4-player rules including player-to-player trading intact. Correctness is enforced by invariant fuzzing, hand-built rule unit tests, and perft-style determinism hashes.

Decisions confirmed by user: greenfield C++, Linux only, full trading from M0 foundations.

## Architecture Summary

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | C++23 | GCC 14.2 → full `std::mdspan`, deducing-this, `std::print`, `std::stacktrace`, multidim subscript. Mature perf tooling (PGO, VTune, SIMD, OpenMP); 26-week solo clock favors known toolchain |
| Binding | nanobind | 2–10× less per-call overhead than pybind11; native DLPack; step() crosses boundary constantly |
| State layout | AoS per game, SoA across batch; ~512 B/env | Five cache lines/env; 1M envs fits RAM easily |
| Action space | Flat discrete ~300, incremental legal-action mask | Masking is the longest branch-heavy path; incremental removes it |
| Trading | Sub-phase compositional encoding | Avoids combinatorial blowup; matches thesis's separate trading net cleanly |
| RNG | xoshiro128+, per-env, 16 B state | 0.5 ns/call, BigCrush-clean, reproducible |
| Parallelism | Single-process `BatchedEnv` + OpenMP parallel-for, auto-reset; multi-process across NUMA | Amortizes OMP launch across thousands of envs; auto-reset kills the slow-env-stalls-batch bug |
| Tensor handoff | DLPack zero-copy via `nanobind::ndarray` | No memcpy per step; PyTorch views same C++ buffer |
| Gym API | Single-agent Gymnasium + perspective flip for self-play; PettingZoo AEC (done in M0) | 99% of RL libs target Gym; AEC wrapper needed only for trading-net training |
| Build | CMake 3.27+ with scikit-build-core; GoogleTest + Google Benchmark via FetchContent | One build system; `pip install -e .` works for dev |
| Platform | Linux x86_64 only; `-std=c++23 -O3 -march=native -flto -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti`, PGO in final mile. Toolchain: GCC 14.2 (Debian) confirmed on dev. | skip macOS/Windows CI complexity |

### Public C++ API (kept minimal)

```cpp
namespace catan {
    void reset_one(GameState& s, uint64_t seed) noexcept;
    void step_one(GameState& s, uint32_t action_id,
                  float& reward_out, uint8_t& done_out) noexcept;
    void write_obs(const GameState& s, uint8_t player_pov, uint8_t* out) noexcept;
}
```

### Public Python API

```python
import fastcatan
env = fastcatan.BatchedEnv(num_envs=4096, seed=42)
obs, mask = env.reset()                              # zero-copy tensors
obs, reward, done, mask, info = env.step(actions)

single = fastcatan.GymEnv(opponent_fn=alpha_beta_policy)  # single-agent wrapper
```

## Key Design Details

### GameState (`include/catan/state.hpp`)

```cpp
struct alignas(64) GameState {
    // Nodes (54): high nibble = owner (0..3, 0xF empty), low nibble = level (0 empty, 1 settlement, 2 city).
    // One byte per slot carries both fields; one load per mask update after a build action.
    uint8_t node[54];

    // Edges (72): 0..3 owner, 0xFF empty. Byte-per-slot; scattered writes make bit-packing a net loss.
    uint8_t edge[72];

    // Board layout (randomized per episode; adjacency is static in topology.hpp).
    uint8_t hex_resource[19];           // 0=brick 1=lumber 2=wool 3=grain 4=ore 5=desert
    uint8_t hex_number[19];             // 0 for desert; else 2..12 skipping 7
    uint8_t port_type[9];               // 0..4 = 2:1 specific, 5 = 3:1 generic; indexed by port slot
    uint8_t robber_hex;

    // Per-player (AoS within env).
    uint8_t  resources[4][5];           // brick, lumber, wool, grain, ore
    uint8_t  dev_cards_playable[4][5];
    uint8_t  dev_cards_pending[4][5];   // bought this turn, not playable yet
    uint8_t  knights_played[4];
    uint8_t  vp_public[4];
    uint8_t  vp_hidden[4];              // VP dev cards
    uint8_t  longest_road_len[4];
    uint8_t  played_dev_this_turn[4];
    uint16_t ports_mask[4];             // bitstring: which ports player can trade through

    // Global.
    uint8_t  dev_deck_remaining[5];
    uint8_t  bank[5];
    uint8_t  longest_road_holder;       // 0xFF if none
    uint8_t  largest_army_holder;
    uint8_t  current_player;
    uint8_t  phase;                     // initial_placement / roll / main / discard / robber / steal / trade_propose / trade_respond
    uint8_t  dice_roll;
    uint8_t  turn_number;

    uint64_t rng_state[2];              // xoshiro128+
    uint64_t action_mask[5];            // incrementally maintained 320-bit bitstring
};
```

~512 bytes/env including alignment. Eight cache lines. 1M envs ≈ 500 MB.

**Encoding choices:**
- `node[54]` merges `owner` + `level` into one byte (nibble-packed). Every build action mutates owner and level together — one load, one store.
- `hex_resource` / `hex_number` stay `uint8_t` (not 3/4-bit packed) because production rolls SIMD-sweep all 19 hexes with `_mm256_cmpeq_epi8` against the rolled number. Bit-packing kills vectorization.
- `action_mask[5]` and `ports_mask[4]` are bitstrings by design — bitwise set ops (`&`, `|`, `popcount`, `tzcnt`) are 1-cycle and dominate action-sampling and port-trade checks.
- Everything else kept byte-wide — scattered read-modify-write cost of bit-packing outweighs cache savings since a whole env already fits in L1 many times over.

Topology (adjacency tables for 19 hexes / 54 nodes / 72 edges / 9 ports) is compile-time constants in `topology.hpp`, generated by `topology_gen.py` at build time.

### Action Space (~300 flat actions)

- Turn management: roll, end turn
- Build: 54 settlement + 54 city + 72 road
- Dev: buy, play {knight, YoP, RB, monopoly}; VP dev is passive
- YoP: 25 resource-pair choices (dedup via mask)
- Monopoly: 5
- Robber: 19 hex × steal-target (masked to ≤4)
- Discard sub-phase: 5 "discard 1 of R" actions, repeated until half shed
- Trade sub-phase: "add 1 of R to give", "add 1 of R to want", finalize, accept, reject, counter — composes instead of enumerating combinations

### Incremental Legal-Action Mask

Every state mutation updates affected mask bits (typically <10 bit flips). `step_one` never scans the board to determine legality. In **debug builds**, after every step, recompute the mask from scratch and `assert(incremental == recomputed)` — leave this on until M4.

### Parallelism

- Layer 1: single env step is ~100–200 ns of work — never thread internally.
- Layer 2: `BatchedEnv` holds N states in one contiguous buffer. `step()` is one `#pragma omp parallel for` over `step_one` calls. Auto-reset when `done_out[i]==1` — no stalls.
- Layer 3: output tensors (`obs_out`, `reward_out`, `done_out`, `mask_out`) are exposed to Python as zero-copy `nb::ndarray` views, wrapped as PyTorch tensors via DLPack. Same tensor object returned each step.
- Layer 4: `step()` releases the GIL (`nb::call_guard<nb::gil_scoped_release>`).
- Layer 5: NUMA-aware multi-process via `torch.multiprocessing` in M4 — one BatchedEnv per socket, shared-memory aggregation. **Do not use `SubprocVecEnv`** — pickling per step is the slow path we're replacing.
- Escape hatch: `BatchedEnv::step_n(num_steps, policy_fn)` runs N steps entirely in C++ with a C-callable policy. Used for random-policy benchmarks and frozen-opponent rollouts, bypassing Python entirely.

### Gymnasium Wrapper

Single-agent API returns obs from the perspective of whichever player is currently to-move. The env internally calls `opponent_fn(obs) -> action` for the 3 frozen opponents until control returns to the learner. `info["current_player_id"]` is always populated.

For trading-net training (M3 self-play+): a PettingZoo AEC wrapper yields control to Python for every player's every decision. Same C++ core, different Python surface.

### Correctness

Enforced at three levels:

1. **Internal invariants & scenarios** (`tests/`, pytest): resource
   conservation, mask legality, phase/flag transitions, determinism
   (fixed-seed trajectory), terminal reward. Scaled to the **10⁷-game gate**
   by the C++ fuzz harness `tests/fuzz_invariants.cpp` — random-legal play, the
   same per-step invariants, OpenMP across cores (`ctest -R invariants` =
   100k-game smoke ~2 s; `build/fuzz_invariants 10000000` = full gate ~3 min).
   **M1 result: 0 invariant violations over 10⁷ games / 4.04×10¹⁰ steps.**
   Finding: ~3 / 10⁷ random games never reach a winner — a rule-correct
   **deadlock** (board built out + dev deck exhausted ⇒ the last 1–2 VP are
   unreachable for every player; seed 2446268 stays ≤9 VP over 10⁸ steps),
   not a bug — every per-step invariant holds throughout. `step_one` has no
   no-progress terminal, so these games end only at the RL episode cap
   (`models/env.py` `MAX_EPISODE_STEPS` → −1).

2. **Cross-engine differential vs Catanatron** (the ground-truth oracle) —
   the M1 gate. A true co-stepping harness drives BOTH engines through the
   same action stream and asserts full state parity every ply. Pieces in
   `EVAL/bridge/` (see `EVAL/bridge/PLAN.md`):
   - `state_mirror.py` — byte-exact ctypes mirror of the 384-B C++
     `GameState`+`BoardLayout` (validated vs live snapshots).
   - `state_inject.py` — serialize any Catanatron state into fastcatan
     (`load_snapshot`).
   - `rng_force.py` — force fastcatan's xoshiro so dice / dev-draw / steal
     reproduce Catanatron's outcome (verified against the C++ engine).
   - `tests/test_differential.py` — co-stepping state parity.
   - `tests/test_obs_identity.py` — C++ `write_obs` vs bridge `encode_obs`
     bit-for-bit (obs layout + normalization parity).

   This is stronger than `test_parity_replay.py` (which only checks the obs
   encoder and never runs fastcatan's engine). It caught and fixed **5 real
   sim bugs** (git log): longest-road title off-by-one (first player to reach
   exactly 5 roads got no title +2 VP); production bank-shortage (all-or-
   nothing per resource, no partial to a sole recipient — matches Catanatron
   `yield_resources`); road buildability through an enemy-occupied component
   node; history-dependent longest-road membership (`road_node_member` field
   added to `GameState`); obs trade-response no-trade mismatch. Plus an
   initial-placement phase mislabel in the bridge encoder.

3. **Known parity bound — Catanatron's longest road is internally
   inconsistent.** It caches lengths (recomputes only the "plowed" player on a
   cut); its connected-component membership for enemy-boundary nodes is
   history-dependent (`build_road` excludes them, `dfs_walk` on a cut re-adds
   them); and it reassigns the title to the lowest seat index among tied
   players on a cut. fastcatan is rule-correct (incumbent keeps the title on a
   tie) and matches Catanatron on ~99% of positions; the residual (≤1–2% of
   random games, road cuts only) is Catanatron's own inconsistency, exempted
   in `test_differential`. Bit-parity there would need porting Catanatron's
   component state machine — not worth it (fastcatan is the correct one).

**Reproducibility** of the differential: pin `random.seed`, `np.random.seed`,
AND `PYTHONHASHSEED` — Catanatron's `RandomPlayer` + set-iteration depend on
all three; without `PYTHONHASHSEED` the corpus is not reproducible run-to-run.

## Milestones

### M0 — Foundations (DONE)

- C++23 simulator + nanobind bindings; Linux-x86_64 CI.
- Full rules: building, dev cards, robber, bank/port + player-to-player trading.
- Gymnasium 4-player env (single-agent wrapper) + PettingZoo AEC.
- Incremental legal-action mask (286 used / 320 bits); surgical trade updater.

### M1 — Correctness, Baselines, Bridge

Goal: validate the C++ sim plays Catan correctly before any RL touches it. Self-play means only the learned policy needs to be fast — baselines stay in Python.

- [x] Random baseline (Python).
- [x] Alpha-Beta baseline (Python): depth-limited minimax + multi-feature heuristic.
- [x] Log capture: random baseline games (action stream, board state, seed). `DEBUG/ui/recorder.py` + `DEBUG/logs/game.jsonl.gz`.
- [x] Log capture: Alpha-Beta baseline games.
- [x] Catanatron bridge: topology map, action codec, obs encoder, run_eval. 281 bridge tests green (`EVAL/bridge/tests/`), verified at the 1084/286 build + catanatron `41ba0db` (2026-05-27).
- [x] Replay parity tests: `EVAL/bridge/tests/test_parity_replay.py` walks shared-seed games action-by-action against Catanatron.
- [x] **Cross-engine differential** (`EVAL/bridge/tests/test_differential.py` + `test_obs_identity.py`): co-steps fastcatan *and* Catanatron on identical action streams, asserts full state + obs parity every ply (via the `state_mirror`/`state_inject`/`rng_force` harness). Found and fixed **5 real sim bugs** (see Correctness). 25-seed corpus green; residual ≤1–2% is Catanatron's own longest-road inconsistency (documented, exempted).
- [x] Throughput + bottleneck dashboard: `DEBUG/bench/bench_throughput.py` (Python-path breakdown) + `DEBUG/bench/bench_step.cpp` & `DEBUG/bench/bench_batched.cpp` (pure-C++ floor, standalone CMake targets). `bench_throughput.py` gives the single-env per-component µs breakdown, batched kernel scaling with nanobind-dispatch isolation, and fastcatan-vs-Catanatron on equal footing (games/s, turns/s; steps/s flagged non-comparable). `DEBUG/bench/bench_comprehensive.py` covers the distribution half (episode length percentiles, win rates per seat, VP). **Bottlenecks named:** single-env baseline is *Python-bound* — the legal-action bit-scan (`legal_actions`) is the largest kernel (~410 ns, ~36% of per-step) and total Python overhead (scan + interpreter glue + policy) is ~80%; the pure-C++ `step_one` is only ~47 ns (Release, `bench_step` replay) ≈ 4% of the per-step budget, with another ~76 ns of nanobind dispatch + return-tuple alloc on top in the bound path. Batched hot path is *obs-encode-bound* — `write_obs` (~80 ns/env, 1084 floats) dominates `step_one` (~40 ns/env) once dispatch amortizes (dispatch floor ~40 ns/call). Note: `step_one` fuses rules+mask-update+RNG and is not separable from Python; combined it is ~47 ns so not the bottleneck. Single-env 0.75M steps/s (Python) vs batched 24M steps/s = the ~32× amortization that justifies `BatchedEnv`; pure-C++ floors are ~21M (single-env `step_one`) and ~11M/core (`bench_batched 4096`, single-thread, near-linear with OpenMP). Equal footing vs Catanatron random4: ~7× games/s and ~7× turns/s.
- [x] 10⁷-game invariant fuzz run. C++ harness `tests/fuzz_invariants.cpp` (OpenMP, random-legal play, per-step invariant checks mirroring the `tests/test_invariants.py` spec: resource conservation, hand-size, VP/piece-stock bounds, phase/player ranges, non-empty mask, terminal winner). CMake target `fuzz_invariants` + `ctest -R invariants` (100k-game smoke, ~2 s). **Full gate green: 10⁷ games, 4.04×10¹⁰ steps, 0 invariant violations** (~176 s, 230M steps/s, 57k games/s on 24 cores). 3 / 10⁷ games hit the 10⁶-step cap without a winner — rule-correct non-termination, not an invariant breach: either a heavy-tail long game (seed 1366915 terminates at 194 018 steps) or a **deadlock** — board built out + dev deck exhausted ⇒ the last 1–2 VP are unreachable for every player (seed 2446268: max VP across all players never exceeds 9 over 10⁸ steps; longest road + largest army already locked). No-winner games have no sim-level terminal; handled at the RL level by `models/env.py` `MAX_EPISODE_STEPS` (truncate → −1).
- **Gate: zero rule divergence vs Catanatron on replay corpus; per-component bottleneck named with measured µs in dashboard.**

### M2 — Initial RL Agent (DONE ✅ — gate met)

- [x] Shared Gym env over `fastcatan.Env` (`models/env.py`, seat 0 = learner, seats 1–3 random).
- [x] MaskablePPO trainer (`models/train_ppo.py`) + checkpoint at `models/checkpoints/ppo_random/ppo_final.zip`.
- [x] Reference trainers in separate files for thesis breadth: A2C, DQN, MuZero scaffold (`models/train_{a2c,dqn,muzero}.py`) + checkpoints.
- [x] Eval harness `models/eval.py` (win rate + 95% Wilson CI vs random over N games).
- [x] Lock observation encoder + reward. **Obs frozen**: 1084 floats, count fields normalized by structural Catan maxima (divisors in `src/catan/obs.cpp` `namespace norm`, mirrored in `EVAL/bridge/obs_encoder.py` + `DEBUG/ui/obs_decoder.py` — keep in sync; verified by `test_obs_identity`). **Reward frozen**: sparse ±1 terminal (+1 on the action reaching 10 VP, −1 if it lets an opponent win), no shaping; `models/env.py` scores a no-winner terminal (the C++ `MAX_TURNS=2000` length cap, or the `MAX_EPISODE_STEPS` learner-step backstop) as **−2** (`TIE_REWARD`), strictly worse than a loss (−1) so the learner closes games out. NOTE: changing obs/reward invalidates trained checkpoints — the old `models/checkpoints/*` were deleted after this freeze.
- [x] ✅ **Stall fixed (two-part, `models/env.py`).** The dominant stall is a *within-turn* `ADD_WANT`→`TRADE_CANCEL` trade-compose loop that never opens a trade nor ends the turn, so `turn_count` (only bumped on END_TURN, `src/catan/rules.cpp:540`) froze and the old `turn_count`-based −1 cap never fired (~85% of greedy/argmax games stalled to the limit). **Primary fix:** a per-turn **trade-compose cap**, now in the C++ core (`MAX_TRADE_COMPOSE_PER_TURN=50`, `include/state.hpp`; masks the TRADE_ADD_GIVE..TRADE_OPEN block once spent, CANCEL/ACCEPT/DECLINE/CONFIRM stay legal so the mask is never emptied; applied to every seat). **Backstop:** a should-never-fire per-episode *learner-step* cap (`MAX_EPISODE_STEPS=40000`); the C++ `MAX_TURNS=2000` terminal is the real length authority. A step-counter cap *alone* is insufficient — it truncates *winnable* games (the policy wins, just after thousands of churn steps, so capping mid-churn scores a win as a loss). **M1 fuzz independently confirmed a no-winner terminal is necessary**: ~3/10⁷ random games reach a rule-correct deadlock (board built out + dev deck exhausted ⇒ last VP unreachable) with no sim-level terminal (see §M1).
- [x] ✅ **Gate MET (2026-05-28).** `ppo_1084_50m` (MaskablePPO, 768 envs, 50M steps, checkpoints every 5M) clears the M2 gate on the 1084/286 build — **95.5%** vs random native (200g, sampling, CI-low 0.917, `models.eval`) and **89.5%** via the bridge vs `RandomPlayer` (200g, `--no-trades`, CI [0.845, 0.930], 0 no-winner). Eval with **sampling** for undertrained models (argmax stalls/underperforms before convergence; 10M steps was too few — converges ~15–20M). This is the verified M3 self-play warm-start seed.
- **Gate: >90% win rate vs random baseline over 1000 four-player games.**

### M3 — Self-Play Training (scaffolding DONE ✅; self-play verified working; full run IN PROGRESS 2026-05-28 — warm-started from the verified 1084 seed `ppo_1084_50m`, see §M2)

Self-contained in `models/selfplay/` (full detail in its `PLAN.md`). **No C++ change
needed**: `Env.write_obs(seat, buf)` is perspective-flipped, so a seat-0-trained policy
plays any seat on that seat's POV obs — opponents are driven from Python, exactly where
`FastCatanEnv` already drives the random ones.

- [x] **Iterative self-play schedule** (`train_selfplay.py`): one MaskablePPO + one
  DummyVecEnv; an `OpponentPool` of frozen snapshots, **shared & mutated across rounds**.
  Each round: `learn(steps_per_round)` → freeze `snap_N.zip` → add to pool → inline gate.
  Warm-start from an M2 checkpoint via `set_parameters` (weights only, so swept lr/ent
  still apply). Per episode the pool samples seats 1-3: prob `p_random` → random
  (anti-collapse / keeps weak-play robustness), else recency-weighted recent snapshots.
  Empty pool → all random, so round 0 auto-bootstraps off random even without warm-start.
  Opponents run on CPU (single-obs inference; ~2× the CUDA per-call rate) → ~1.3k fps.
- [x] **Hyperparam sweep** (`sweep.py`): grids lr × ent × snapshot-interval × arch ×
  **lr-schedule × target-kl** — the last two added to fight self-play's diminishing
  per-round returns (linear lr decay settles late rounds vs oscillating; KL early-stop
  keeps updates conservative as the opponent pool shifts each round). One subprocess per
  cell → `summary.json` → aggregated CSV/markdown table.
- [x] **Gate recalibrated to balanced 2-vs-2** (`gate.py`): the naive 1-vs-3 (seat0=latest
  vs 3×N-ago) has neutral **0.25** in a 4-player game, making `>0.55` a "win >2× fair
  share" dominance bar rather than "better than". 2-vs-2 (2 seats latest, 2 N-ago, seat
  assignment rotated to cancel seat bias) → **neutral 0.50**, so `>0.55` = meaningfully
  better, the intended semantics. Wilson CI + a `conclusive` guard (fails honestly when
  too many games stall). `eval_seats.py` keeps the per-seat 1-vs-3 diagnostic.
- [x] **Self-play works** (smoke warm-started from an M2 vs-random checkpoint,
  `--no-p2p-trade`): improves **monotonically** — per-seat
  4-way newest-vs-r3/r2/r1 = 0.42 / 0.34 / 0.19 / 0.06; recalibrated gate r4-vs-r3 =
  **0.642 PASS**, equal-policy = 0.483 (neutral confirmed). Mechanically flawless (0%
  no-winner under `--no-p2p-trade`, clean CIs). Earlier "instability" was a misread of the
  miscalibrated 1-vs-3 gate; under 2-vs-2 every round beats its predecessor.
- [x] **PFSP league** (`league.py`, opt-in `--league`): a bounded **best-N archive**
  (`--league-size 32`) sampled by **prioritized fictitious self-play** instead of the
  recency window — opponents weighted by how often they currently beat the learner
  (`--pfsp hard` `(1-p)^β` default, or `even` `p(1-p)`). Win-rates `p_i` come **free** from
  the training rollouts (`SelfPlayEnv.step` credits each league opponent at the table;
  `--league-decay` fades old counts to track the improving learner). "Best N" = **hybrid**:
  always keep the most-recent `--league-recent` (8), fill the rest with the hardest-for-the-
  learner, evict the easiest non-recent on overflow. Drop-in for `OpponentPool` (same
  `sample()` surface) → an A/B against the window pool. Logic unit-tested; **not yet run at
  scale** (same 1084-seed blocker below).
- [x] **`--resume` crash-continue** (`train_selfplay.py`): re-running was a *restart* (loop
  from round 0, empty pool, snapshot numbering + gate log reset). `--resume` is a real
  *continue*: glob `snap_*.zip` → rebuild pool/league → `MaskablePPO.load` the latest
  (optimizer + `num_timesteps`, so numbering keeps going) → start at round N → append the
  gate log. Schedule/gate flags persist to `run_config.json` (restored on resume so the
  linear-lr decay / gate rules can't drift); gate log streams to `gate_log.jsonl`; league
  archive+stats to `league_state.json`. Inline gate now loads its two contestants from the
  append-only on-disk `snap_paths`, so "latest vs N-ago" is correct under resume AND league
  eviction. Just re-pass `--run-name`.
- [x] ✅ **Trade-loop stall RESOLVED**: four strong policies used to stall the
  TRADE_OPEN/CANCEL loop → no winner → gate undecidable. Fixed by the per-turn
  **trade-compose cap**, now in the C++ core (`MAX_TRADE_COMPOSE_PER_TURN=50`,
  `state.hpp`, all seats). The M3 sweep then passed the gate with **trades ON**
  (12/12 conclusive, 0 no-winner; see the M3-result bullet below), so
  `--no-p2p-trade` is no longer required — it stays as an optional ablation.
- [~] **Run the schedule + sweep + league — IN PROGRESS 2026-05-28** (running now,
  warm-started from the verified 1084 seed `ppo_1084_50m`, §M2 — 95.5% vs random
  native / 89.5% via bridge — via `--init-from
  models/checkpoints/ppo_1084_50m/ppo_final.zip`). Interface is **1084/286** (anaconda
  build — run in anaconda). **Curriculum: random-first (M2)
  → warm-start self-play** is the right order — sparse ±1 reward can't cold-start against
  strong opponents; keep `p_random` > 0 throughout. All M3 code reads `OBS_SIZE`/
  `NUM_ACTIONS` dynamically, so it runs unchanged on 1084. **This was believed to be the
  thesis critical path**: M4 confirmed a random-trained agent scores 0 vs AlphaBeta (§M4),
  so self-play was assumed to be the route to the >25% gate — **⚠️ but as of 2026-06-01
  this is FALSIFIED for the pure policy-gradient recipe: see the M3-result + M4 bullets below.**
- **Gate: latest model beats N-step-ago snapshot >55% (balanced 2-vs-2, neutral 0.50, conclusive).**
- [x] ✅ **M3 self-play gate MET, trades ON** (2026-05-30): full 12-cell sweep on the
  turn-cap env = 12/12 conclusive, 0.000 no-winner everywhere, 6/12 cells pass >0.55 (best
  256,256/ent0.01/const 0.825). Both stall caps now live in the **C++ core**
  (`MAX_TURNS=2000` + `MAX_TRADE_COMPOSE_PER_TURN=50`; the Python ComposeCapper + every
  `--trade-compose-cap` arg were deleted). Detail in `models/selfplay/PLAN.md`.
- [x] ⚠️ **At-scale league run shows self-play does NOT transfer to AlphaBeta** (2026-06-01):
  `sp_league_200m_512` — 512×512×256, **200M steps**, `--league` PFSP-hard, trades ON,
  warm-started from `ppo_512x512x256_50m` (93% vs-random). League gate r3 = **0.66 PASS**
  (genuinely beats its 100M-ago self) and **86.7% vs-random**, yet **0/200 vs AlphaBeta**
  (§M4) — identical to the pre-self-play seed. The self-play improvement is **real but
  orthogonal to minimax**. **Do NOT chase this with more steps (200M→0 movement).**
- [x] **Capacity sweep extended past 256,256 — bigger does NOT help *or* hurt on the M3
  gate (2026-06-03).** Curve 64→128→256 climbs (0.555→0.755→0.825); the next point
  512,512,256 (warm-started from the free seed `ppo_512x512x256_50m`,
  `models/checkpoints/arch_sweep_xl/`) lands ent0.01/**linear 0.775 PASS** ≈ 256,256, with
  ent0/const **0.19** and ent0.01/const **0.275**. Those low cells are **constant-lr
  instability, not a capacity penalty**, and the apparent late-round "regression"
  (gate → 0.19) is a **self-referential-gate artifact**: on the FIXED vs-random anchor the
  same ent0.01/const final is monotone UP (seed 94.7% → r4 96% → r6 **98.5%**). So
  **256,256 was never a capacity ceiling** — bigger nets match it once lr is annealed. A
  24-round "more time" run (`models/selfplay/run_512_long.sh`, ent0.01+linear) is confirming
  the trajectory; a 2048,2048,1024 (17.3M) seed exists (`models/checkpoints/seeds/2048-2048-1024/`)
  but its sweep was **stood down** — see M4 for why capacity is moot for the gate that matters.

### M4 — Alpha-Beta Eval + Final Model

> Harness lives in `EVAL/AB/`, run in the **anaconda** 1084/286 env: the trained policy
> plays seat RED via `EVAL/bridge/CatanatronBridge` inside Catanatron's engine vs
> `AlphaBetaPlayer`. Catanatron is a **pinned git build** (`41ba0db`; root
> `requirements.txt`, `EVAL/AB/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` §6), not PyPI.

- [x] Tournament harness (`EVAL/AB/tournament.py` + `EVAL/AB/policy.py`): policy-via-bridge vs `AlphaBetaPlayer`/`ValueFunctionPlayer`/`RandomPlayer`, win rate + 95% Wilson CI + the thesis gate (CI-low > 0.25) → `EVAL/AB/results/*.json`. Pipeline validated end-to-end on the 1084/286 interface (`test_obs_identity` 5/5 encoder↔C++ parity; uniform-bridge games vs Value/AlphaBeta complete — `EVAL/AB/results/validation_1084.md`).
- [~] Final model vs Alpha-Beta over ≥1000 four-player games. **Harness ran live (2026-05-27) on the 1084 M2 seed `ppo_1084_50m`: 0/200 vs AlphaBeta** (depth 2, `--ab-prune`, `--no-trades`, CI [0, 0.019], gate FAIL) and 0/5 with trades. **Verified the 0 is real, not a EVAL/bridge/plumbing bug (2026-05-28):** the *same model, same harness, swapping AlphaBeta→`RandomPlayer`* scores **179/200 (89.5%)**, and **95.5%** native vs random — so the bridge faithfully conveys the model's skill; a random-trained PPO genuinely cannot beat AlphaBeta. AlphaBeta ≈6.4 s/game unpruned (~1.8 h/1000); use `--ab-prune` (~1.4 s/game).
- [~] ⚠️ **Re-test on the M3 self-play model (2026-06-01): STILL 0/200 vs AlphaBeta.** The stronger model now exists — `sp_league_200m_512/selfplay_final.zip` (200M-step league self-play off the 512×512×256 seed, league gate r3=0.66 PASS, 86.7% vs-random) — and it scored **0/200** (depth 2, `--ab-prune`, `--no-trades`, CI [0, 0.019]; `EVAL/AB/results/tournament_ppo_alphabeta_20260601_100313.json`), the same as the seed. **So "train a stronger PPO via self-play" did NOT crack the gate** — the gains don't transfer to minimax play. **The open path to >25% is no longer "more self-play":** (1) diagnose the 0 first — same model vs the weaker `ValueFunctionPlayer` (`--opponent value`) + earlier snapshots vs AlphaBeta, to confirm a real skill wall vs a bridge-seat artifact; (2) put AlphaBeta/ValueFunction bots **into the self-play opponent pool** (it's currently PPO-snapshots only, so the agent never trains against lookahead); (3) add **MCTS/AlphaZero-style search at inference** (the policy net as a prior) — the standard way pure policies beat minimax. See `models/selfplay/PLAN.md` + memory `m4-alphabeta-blocked-on-m3`.
- [x] **Native AlphaBeta opponent — unblocks path (2) (2026-06-02).** AlphaBeta is now ported into the fastcatan C++ engine (`src/catan/search.cpp`, `Env.ab_decide`/`ab_value`) — a faithful catanatron `AlphaBetaPlayer` port (value fn matches `base_fn` to **1.9e-16**; deterministic moves are tie-for-optimal with catanatron — `EVAL/AB/test_native_ab_fidelity.py`). It runs ~750× faster than the bridge AB (depth-1 ~45k learner-steps/s, depth-2 ~5k), so the learner can **train directly against AlphaBeta**: `train_ppo.py --opponent alphabeta [--ab-depth 1] [--ab-prune]`. This is the *opponent-in-pool* lever; whether it transfers to this bridge gate is the next experiment. Fidelity + usage in `EVAL/AB/README.md`, memory `native-alphabeta-training-opponent`. (Bonus: doing this surfaced + fixed a `EVAL/bridge/state_mirror.py` drift that had silently broken the inject path — differential 25/25, bridge 281/281 green again; memory `bridge-state-mirror-resync`.)
- [~] ⚠️ **3rd model + native-AB depth ladder — wall reconfirmed, capacity/time ruled out (2026-06-03).** A *different, stronger* self-play model — a 512×512×256 **sliding-window** arch-sweep cell (only 6M steps but **98.5% vs random**, `models/checkpoints/sweep/lr0.0003_ent0.01_int1000000_arch512-512-256_constant_klnone/snap_6021120.zip`) — ALSO scores **0/100 vs catanatron-AB d2** on the official bridge (`--no-trades`, CI [0, 0.037], `EVAL/AB/results/tournament_ppo_alphabeta_20260603_022546.json`). So the wall holds across two unrelated self-play recipes (200M league + 6M sliding-window) **and** across capacity (cf. M3: 512≈256) → robustly **not a model-quality fluke**. Mapped the **native** AB port (`Env.ab_decide`) as a depth ladder for this model: seed 4%/4%, model d1 **48.7%**, d2 **22%** — i.e. graded transfer to the *native* port, BUT (a) **confounded by trades ON** (`FastCatanEnv` has no `--no-trades` flag, and this trade-trained model banks trade exploits the bridge forbids — does **not** prove the native port is weaker, whose `ab_value` fidelity is separately validated) and (b) still 0 vs catanatron. **Conclusion: more network capacity and more self-play time monotonically lift vs-random / native-AB strength but do NOT transfer to depth-2 catanatron — the M4 lever is search at inference (path 3), not a bigger or longer-trained reactive policy.** Memory `arch-sweep-xl-running`, `m4-alphabeta-blocked-on-m3`, `native-alphabeta-training-opponent`.
- [~] 10⁸-step soak test for stability: harness done (`EVAL/AB/soak.py` — finite-obs + mask-integrity + RSS-leak checks); smoked green (10k steps, RSS flat 1.00×); full run pending (~24 min at ~70k steps/s).
- [x] Reproducibility doc: `EVAL/AB/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` (toolchain, build flags + `editable.rebuild=true`, anaconda env, catanatron git pin, seeds, training config).
- **Thesis gate: >25% win rate vs Alpha-Beta with 95% CI** (Wilson CI lower bound > 0.25).

## Top 3 Risks

### Risk 1: Longest Road is a graph problem with subtle corner cases

Road length on a graph with opponent-cuts is hamiltonian-path-ish. Getting it wrong is silent in short games and hard to debug in long ones.

**Mitigation.** Isolate `longest_road.cpp` from day one. Write its tests first. Hand-build a corpus of ~200 positions, each with the known correct length per player, covering ties, cuts by opponent settlement, branching, and cycle cases. Run on every commit. Never write this from memory.

### Risk 2: Incremental mask goes out of sync with state

A stale mask bit lets the agent pick an illegal action; the sim either crashes or silently executes it. Training data corrupts invisibly.

**Mitigation.** Debug builds `assert(incremental == recomputed)` after every `step_one`. Keep on through M3 self-play; only turn off for the M4 final thesis runs. ~2× debug slowdown is cheap insurance. Seed-reproducible fuzz tests surface drift before it reaches real training.

### Risk 3: Python↔C++ boundary dominates step time at high N

At 5×10⁷ steps/sec with N=4096 envs, a `step()` call is ~80 µs of native work; nanobind dispatch + tensor lifecycle is ~5–20 µs. 6–25% overhead is tolerable but invisible in C++ microbenches.

**Mitigation.** Benchmark from Python from M1 baselines, not just from C++. Release GIL in `step()`. Same tensors reused across calls, zero per-step Python work. If still binding at M3 self-play, ship the `step_n(num_steps, policy_fn)` C-callable escape hatch for benchmarks and frozen-opponent rollouts.

## Verification

- **Invariants:** `ctest -R invariants` runs a fast 100k-game smoke (~2 s); the full thesis gate is `build/fuzz_invariants 10000000` (10⁷ games, ~3 min, 24 cores). Both check per-step invariants over random-legal play; must be green (0 violations) before any throughput claim is made.
- **Determinism:** `ctest -R perft` runs fixed-seed/fixed-policy 100k-step trajectory, compares hash to the committed value.
- **Throughput:** `python -m fastcatan.benchmarks.throughput --n-envs 4096 --steps 100000 --warmup 1000` reports steps/sec. Run 3× under `numactl --cpubind=0 --membind=0`; take median. Gate on per-milestone target.
- **RL smoke test (M2 onward):** `python scripts/ppo_smoke.py` — 1M-step PPO run vs random opponent, must reach >90% win rate.
- **Final (M4):** `python scripts/tournament.py --agent-a ppo_final --agent-b alphabeta --n-games 1000` reports win rate + 95% CI.
