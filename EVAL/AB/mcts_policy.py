"""State-aware MCTS policy for the catanatron bridge — the M4 instrument.

The bridge's plain PolicyFn is (obs, mask, rng) -> fast-id, which is enough
for a reactive net but not for search: MCTS needs the LIVE game state. This
policy reads the catanatron ``Game`` the bridge stashes on itself each
``decide()`` (``bridge._game``), injects it into a scratch fastcatan Env via
``bridge.state_inject.inject`` (the byte-validated mirror the AB-fidelity
tests use), and runs the hybrid MCTSvsFixed from that snapshot:

    learned prior (IL clone) proposes -> native ab_value judges the leaves
    (deterministic, two-scale lexicographic squash) -> 256-1024 stochastic
    sims out-search AB's fixed 1-2 ply.

This is the configuration that scored 29.0% [25.5-32.8] pooled (>=512 sims,
600 games) vs native AB-d1 — above 4-player parity — and 23.3% vs d2.

The chosen fast-id must land in the BRIDGE's mask (catanatron's
playable_actions reverse-mapped); the root mask of the injected state should
agree (mask-consistency tests), but sub-prompt shapes can differ, so we pick
the highest-visit action within the bridge mask and fall back to rng.choice
as a last resort (counted, reported at teardown).

Wiring (circular by construction):
    policy = MctsStatePolicy(net, seat=k, ...)
    bridge = CatanatronBridge(color, policy=policy, ...)
    policy.bridge = bridge
