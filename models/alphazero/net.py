"""Policy + value network for AlphaZero Catan.

Shared MLP trunk (matches the 512x512x256 width that worked for PPO) feeding two
heads:
  - policy: logits over all NUM_ACTIONS (masked to legal at use time)
  - value:  scalar in [-1, 1] via tanh = predicted final outcome (+1 win / -1 not)
            for the seat whose POV the observation is encoded from.

The value is POV-relative on purpose: the obs encoder already emits each seat's
view with "self" at slot 0, so one scalar head serves all four seats. MCTS reads
the value from each seat's POV to build its length-4 backup vector.
