"""Mixed opponent league for AlphaZero (the fix for the no-win collapse).

Training only against AlphaBeta flat-lines: a scratch/0.6 net never wins, value targets
have no variance, gradient dies (see [[alphazero-v1-built]]). The league keeps BEATABLE
opponents in the pool so some games are wins -> value-target variance -> gradient lives,
while AlphaBeta sits in the pool as the target whose sampling weight auto-ramps as the
learner improves.

Pool members (each: `.name`, `.act(env, seat, legal) -> action`):
  - RandomOpp        floor difficulty; guarantees winnable games at scratch start.
  - ABOpp(depth)     native Catanatron-AB port (ab_decide); d1 + d2 both in the pool.
  - SnapshotOpp      a frozen past-self PolicyValueNet (greedy policy head, no MCTS).

PFSP: weight_m = x_m*(1-x_m) + floor, x_m = learner win-rate vs m. Peaks at x=0.5
(challenging-but-beatable) and the floor keeps every member — including AB the learner
can't yet beat — in the sampling mix. Per game, each opponent seat draws a member
independently by weight.

The same per-seat dispatcher drives BOTH the real game and the in-tree opponent model
(MCTSvsFixed.opp), so the search models each seat's actual opponent.
